Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: "{{ hosts }}"
      roles:
         - { role: osm_java }

Note
--------

* This will install openjdk java not oracle.
* Playbooks are made for debian and redhat both so while passing argument change the name.
